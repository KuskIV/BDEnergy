\paragraph{Initial Measurements}: As was presented in \cref{subsec:cochran}, Cochrans formula is used to ensure confidence in the measurements made. The initial measurements will be measurements made to gain insight into how many measurements are required, before making more measurements if required. The number chosen for the initial measurements is 30, as according to the central limit theorem, a sample size of minimum 30 is usually enough to ensure that teh sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population.\cite{central-limit-theorem}





% Choosing 30 as the number of times to run an experiment is a good choice because, according to the central limit theorem, a sample size of at least 30 is typically sufficient to ensure that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population, thus providing reliable estimates of population parameters.
