\subsection{Experiment One}

In the first experiment, \textbf{RQ1} will be explored. This experiment will be using both multi core test cases presented in \cref{subsec:test_cases} and the measurements will be performed using IPG. IPG was chosen as this was deemed the best measuring instrument in \cite{biksbois}, where it was also observed how IPG and LHM made similar measurements. Given the point of this experiment is to find the best compiler, the expectations would be that a similar conclusion would be made if multiple measuring instruments were used.
