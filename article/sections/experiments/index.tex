\section{Experiments}\label[section]{experiments}

In the following section, the conducted experiments are analyzed. All experiments were carried out on the framework presented in \cref{app:framework}, with the results stored in the database introduced in \cref{app:database}. During the experiments, the \texttt{ProcessPriorityClass} for the measuring instrument, framework, and benchmarks was set to \texttt{High}, unless specified otherwise. In addition to this, suggestions made by \cite{Ournani2020, Lindholt2022} were followed, meaning C-states, Turbo Boost and hyperthreading was disabled. On Linux, Wi-Fi was disabled when benchmarks were running, but no background processes were stopped as no effect of doing this was found by \cite{Ournani2020}. No analysis on the effect of background processes on Windows was found, which is why the background processes presented in \cref{subsec:backgroundProcess} was disabled in addition to the Wi-Fi. The benchmarks were executed right after each other in all experiments, as \cite{Ournani2020} did not find any effect of either restarts or sleep between executions. When using Cochran's formula, a confidence level of $95\%$ and a margin of error of $0.03\%$ was used, as \cite{biksbois} found that to be fitting.
