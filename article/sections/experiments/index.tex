\section{Experiments}\label[section]{experiments}

In the following section, the conducted experiments are analyzed. All experiments carried out utilized the framework detailed in \cref{app:framework}, with the results stored in the database introduced in \cref{app:database}. During the experiments, the \texttt{ProcessPriorityClass} for the measuring instrument, framework, and benchmarks was set to \texttt{High}, unless specified otherwise by the particular experiment. In addition to this, suggestions made by \cite{Ournani2020, Lindholt2022} are followed, meaning C-states, Turbo Boost and hyperthreading will be disabled for both DUTs for all experiments. On Linux, WIFI will be disabled when benchmarks are running, but no background processes as \cite{Ournani2020} did not find any effect of this. No analysis on the effect of background processes on Windows was found, which is why the background processes presented in \cref{subsec:backgroundProcess} will be disabled in addition to the WIFI. The benchmarks will be executed right after each other in all experiments, as \cite{Ournani2020} did not find any effect of either restarts or sleep between benchmarks.
