To compare the predicted speedup from Amdahl's Law to the actual speedup achieved, you'll need to follow these steps:

    Run the benchmark on a single core: Execute the original, non-parallelized version of your program on a single core or processor, and measure its execution time (T_serial).

    Determine the fractions S and P: Analyze your code to identify the serial (S) and parallel (P) portions, as previously discussed.

    Predict the speedup using Amdahl's Law: Use the formula Sp = 1 / (S + (P / N)) to predict the potential speedup (Sp_predicted) when using N cores (e.g., 10 cores in your example).

    Implement the parallel version: Modify your code to incorporate parallelism using a suitable parallel programming model, as previously discussed.

    Run the benchmark on multiple cores: Execute the parallelized version of your program on multiple cores (e.g., 10 cores), and measure its execution time (T_parallel).

    Calculate the actual speedup: Divide the single-core execution time (T_serial) by the multi-core execution time (T_parallel) to obtain the actual speedup (Sp_actual), as previously discussed.

    Compare the predicted and actual speedups: Analyze the difference between the predicted speedup (Sp_predicted) from Amdahl's Law and the actual speedup (Sp_actual) achieved by your parallelized program. This comparison can help you understand the efficiency of your parallelization efforts and identify any potential bottlenecks or areas for further optimization.




From a 3DM, DUT 2 using 10 cores.
start: 0.06699943542480469
end: 41.49199676513672
Time total = Ttotal = 41,4249973297

Time serial = Ts
~ Ts start: 0.06699943542480469
~ Ts end: 13.687000274658203

~ Ts start: 32.38800048828125
~ Ts end: 41.49199676513672
~Ts: (13,687000274658203 - 0,06699943542480469) + (41,49199676513672 - 32,38800048828125) = 22,7239971161


Fraction of the serial portion (S)
S = Ts / Ttotal = 22,7239971161 / 41,4249973297 = 0,5485576000

Fraction of the parallel portion (P).
P = 1 - S = 1 - 0,5485576000 = 0,4514424


Compute the speedup factor (Sp) for the task using Amdahl's Law formula:

Sp = 1 / (S + (P / N))
Sp = 1 / (0,5485576000 + (0,4514424 / 10)) = 1,6843471464
where Sp is the speedup factor, N is the number of processing elements or cores, and S and P are the fractions of the task that are serial and parallel, respectively.
