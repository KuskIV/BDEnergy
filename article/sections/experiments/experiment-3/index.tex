\subsection{Experiment Three}\label{subsec:exp_three}

The third experiment will answer \texttt{RQ3-4}. This will done by taking a look at the per-core performance of the two CPU's used in this work. This will be tested using single-core test cases introduced in \cref{subsec:test_cases}, by running each test case on one core at a time, while measuring the energy consumption using IPG and Clamp. This will show how the performance is between P- and E-cores, and how the performance is between cores with the same specifications.

\paragraph{Per-Core Initial Measurements:} The first measurements made, will be in order to compare the per-core performance, where $250$ measurements will be made for each test case on each core. After $250$ measurements, more measurements were made where it was required, as can be found in \cref{app:exp_three_coch}, with an upper limit of $1000$ measurements.

\paragraph{Per-Core Results:} When presenting the results, it will be based on DUT 2 and test case SN, where the other results can be found in \cref{app:exp_three}. DUT 2 contains
