\subsection{Experiment Three}\label{subsec:exp_three}

The third experiment investigated \cref{RQ:RQ3,RQ:RQ4}, by taking a look at the per-core performance. In this experiment only IPG and the Clamp was used to conduct measurements. The test case was executed on one core at a time using the single-core test cases introduced in \cref{subsec:test_cases}. This allowed a comparison between the energy consumption of the P- and E-cores on DUT 2 and the P-cores on DUT 1.

%The test case used in this experiment was the single-core test cases introduced in \cref{subsec:test_cases}, by running each test case on one core at a time, while measuring the energy consumption using IPG and Clamp. This will show how the performance is between P- and E-cores, and how the performance is between cores with the same specifications.

\paragraph{Per-Core Initial Measurements:} An initial $250$ measurements were made for each test case on each core. Then Cochran's formula was calculated to determine if more measurements were required as shown in \cref{app:exp_three_coch}. However the limit of $1000$ measurements set in experiment two was still used.

%The first measurements were made, will be in order to compare the per-core performance, where $250$ measurements will be made for each test case on each core. After $250$ measurements, more measurements were made where it was required, as can be found in \cref{app:exp_three_coch}, with an upper limit of $1000$ measurements.

\paragraph{Per-Core Results:} The results, presented here are based on DUT 2 and with the test case SN, the remaining results can be found in \cref{app:exp_three}. The CPU in DUT 2 has 6 P-cores and 4 E-cores as can be seen in \cref{fig:3-same-one-api-compiler-different-cores-ipg-spectral-norm.exe-intel-one-api-workstationtwo-cpu-dec,fig:3-same-one-api-compiler-different-cores-ipg-spectral-norm.exe-intel-one-api-workstationtwo-cpu-dec_per_second,fig:3-same-one-api-compiler-different-cores-ipg-spectral-norm.exe-intel-one-api-workstationtwo-runtime-duration} showing the DEC, DEC per second and duration respectively. The run time was on average $76.26\%$ lower on the P-cores compared to the E-cores and The total DEC was on average $70.44\%$ lower on P cores, however the E cores had a $72.88\%$ lower energy consumption per second. %When comparing  P- and E-cores, the duration is on average is $76.26\%$ lower on P cores, the energy consumption is $70.44\%$ lower on P cores over the entire duration, while E cores has a $72.88\%$ lower energy consumption per second.
The largest difference between two cores of the same type was found on DUT 1 with test case NB, where the performance was $11.61\%$ worse on core 1 than core 6. The smallest difference was found on DUT 2, test case NB on a E core, where the energy consumption was $1.17\%$ higher on core $6$ than core $9$.

%When comparing cores of the same type, the largest difference between the best and worst performing core was found on DUT 2, with test case NB,
