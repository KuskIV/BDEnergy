\subsection{Experiment Two}\label{subsec:exp_two}

The second experiment investigated \cref{RQ:RQ2}, in order to identify our preferred measuring instrument on Windows. The measuring instrument was chosen based on a combination of different factors, including its correlation with our ground truth, ease of use and cost. 

A couple of changes were made in the experimental setup for experiment two. Firstly, due to some issues with SCAP, where its sampling rate significantly decreased when the DUT was under full load, the process priority class of the test case was set to \texttt{Normal}. Secondly, due to an execution time of less than a second for \texttt{MB} when compiled with Intel's oneApi, \texttt{MB's} input parameter was changed from $16.000$ to $64.000$ which increased the duration of the test case execution time to $\sim 14$ seconds. This avoided a scenario where the Plug only had a single data point per measurement. For this experiment, \texttt{FR} was executed $550$ times, while \texttt{MB} was executed $222$ times, based on \cref{tab:initial-measurements}.

\paragraph{Initial Measurements:} When analyzing how many measurements is required when applying Cochrans to the results can be seen in \cref{app:exp_two_coch}. %In the cases where there were not enough measurements, the number from Cochran's formula was used to decide how many measurements each measuring instrument needed respectively. 
The Clamp requires significantly more measurements in this case compared to other measuring instruments, which is why a more in depth analysis was conducted. In \cref{fig:evolution_of_medians} boxplots showing the evolution of the DEC when performing between $200-3.000$ measurements. The median decreased by $5.84\%$ from $200$ measurements to $3.000$ measurements, and by $0.3\%$ between $2.800$ and $3.000$ measurements. A pattern was observed, where the median decreased as more measurements are made, until measurements $1.000$, after which the DEC increases until measurement $1.400$ by $2\%$, after which it decreases again. In the last $1.400$ measurements the DEC has converged where the DEC increases by $0.2\%$. The DEC at $1.000$ measurements is $0.29\%$ from the DEC at $3.000$, and due to the excessive time required to run the experiments, we have capped the maximum amount of measurement at $1000$ for this experiment. When looking at the evolution of Cochran's formula for the different measurements, $15.137$ ends up being the amount of measurements required, where the evolution of this number can be found in \cref{app:cockh_exp}. This number is higher compared to other measuring instruments, and this will be analyzed further in the discussion.
%, but given how little the median changes, the argument is made that if Cochran's formula states that more than $1.000$ measurements are required, it will be capped at that.

\paragraph{Results:} When analyzing the results, it will be done for DUT 1 using barcharts as the deviation in the results in limited, where boxplots for boths duts can be found in \cref{app:exp_two}.

When applying statistical methods from \cref{subsec:Statistics}, it was discovered that some of the data did not follow a normal distribution and were significantly different from eachother, previous studies \cite{biksbois, Koedijk2022diff} have had simliar results. Thus, Kendalls Tau Correlation Coefficient was used, and the results for the two test cases can be seen in \cref{fig:fannkuchCorr} and \cref{app:cor_exp_two}.

All DUTs showed moderate to high correlation with the ground truth (Clamp) when assessed with the Guildford Scale. The measuring instruments varied in their correlation performance, with SCAPI being the best but with very few data points logged, this is also the case with SCAP. LHM and IPG being essentially equal in performance for both test cases which Slight diviations. Since usability is also a factor, IPG was chosen as the best measuring instrument and will be used for future experiments on Windows.
