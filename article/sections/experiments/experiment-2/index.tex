\subsection{Experiment Two}\label[subsec]{subsec:exp_two}

The second experiment investigated \cref{RQ:RQ2}, in order to identify the best measuring instrument on Windows. The best measuring instrument will in this study be based on a combination of different factors, including its correlation with our ground truth, ease of use and availability. 

A couple of changes were made in the experimental setup for experiment two. Firstly, due to some issues with SCAP, where its sampling rate significantly decreased when the DUT was under full load, the process priority class of the benchmark was set to \texttt{Normal}. Secondly, due to an execution time of less than a second for MB when compiled with oneAPI, MB's parameter was changed from $16.000$ to $64.000$ which increased the execution time of the benchmark to $\sim 14$ seconds. This avoided a scenario where the Plug only had a single data point per measurement. For this experiment, FR was executed $550$ times, while MB was executed $222$ times, based on \cref{tab:initial-measurements}.

\paragraph{Measuring Instrument Initial Measurements:} the required number of measurements for this experiment, found by applying Cochran's formula to the measurements, can be found in \cref{app:exp_two_coch}. %In the cases where there were not enough measurements, the number from Cochran's formula was used to decide how many measurements each measuring instrument needed respectively. 
From \cref{app:exp_two_coch} it was found that the Clamp requires more measurements compared to other measuring instruments, which is why a more in depth analysis was conducted. This analysis was made by performing $3.000$ MB measurements by the Clamp on DUT 2, where the result from this experiment can be seen in \cref{fig:evolution_of_medians}. In \cref{fig:evolution_of_medians} the evolution of the average DEC is illustrated, as more measurements were made, where the median DEC was found to decrease by $5.84\%$ between when $200$ measurements were made to when $3.000$ measurements were made, and by $0.3\%$ between $2.800$ and $3.000$ measurements. A pattern was observed, where the median decreased as more measurements were made, until measurements $1.000$, after which the average DEC increased until measurement $1.400$ by $2\%$, after which it decreased again. In the last $1.400$ measurements the average DEC had converged where the average DEC increased by $0.2\%$. The average DEC at $1.000$ measurements was $0.29\%$ from the DEC at $3.000$, and due to the excessive time required to run the experiments, the maximum amount of measurement were capped at $1000$ for this experiment. In \cref{app:cockh_exp} a graph is illustrated, showing how many measurements Cochran's formula indicated would be required, as the number of measurements increased. After $3.000$ measurements, the number of measurements ended up being $15.137$. This number is higher compared to other measuring instruments, and this will be analyzed further in the discussion.
%, but given how little the median changes, the argument is made that if Cochran's formula states that more than $1.000$ measurements are required, it will be capped at that.


\paragraph{Measuring Instrument Results:} %When analyzing the results, it will be done for DUT 1 using barcharts in \cref{fig:dut-1-compare-mi} as the deviation in the results is limited, where boxplots for boths duts can be found in \cref{app:exp_two}. 
the results for this experiment, is presented in \cref{fig:dut-1-compare-mi}. In \cref{fig:dut-1-compare-mi}, MB was found to have lower energy consumption than FR in all cases except for RAPL. When comparing the different software measuring instruments for Windows, they were in all cases within $25$ joules of each other, where IPG reported the lowest DEC and SCAPI reported the highest DEC. When the hardware measuring instruments were compared, the Plug reported a higher DEC than the Clamp in all cases except FR on Linux. For OSs, Linux was found to have a higher DEC for both the Plug and Clamp, where RAPL under reports compared to the Clamp in all cases, which was also found on Windows for FR. For MB however, all software based measuring instruments over reported the DEC compared to the Clamp.

% In \cref{fig:dut-1-compare-mi}, MB had a lower energy consumption than FR for all measuring instruments except RAPL, where SCAP, LHM and IPG had measurements within 25 joules of each other. When comparing hardware measuring instruments, the Clamp 



% The Clamp (W) measurements are lower than the Plug (W) on both benchmarks, while compared to SCAP, SCAPI, LHM and IPG it is lower for \texttt{MB}, but higher for \texttt{FR}. When comparing between OSs, Windows can be observed to have a lower DEC and Linux. Boxplots for both DUTs can be found in \cref{app:exp_two}.

When the statistical method from \cref{subsec:Statistics} were applied, the data was was found not to follow a normal distribution, was was also found in \cite{biksbois, Koedijk2022diff}.% Thus, Kendall's Tau Correlation Coefficient was used.%, and the results for the two benchmarks can be seen in \cref{fig:fannkuchCorr} and \cref{app:cor_exp_two}.


The correlation between the measuring instruments for MB on DUT 1 can be seen in \cref{fig:mandelCorrDut1}, where it was found that all software based measuring instruments had a moderate to high correlation between $0.66$ - $0.7$ to the Clamp, when assessed with the Guildford Scale. The Plug was found to have a moderate correlation of $0.64$. The correlations for FR were found to be more correlated compared to MB, but still within the same categories of either a moderate or hight correlation, as can be found in \cref{app:cor_exp_two} alongside the correlations for DUT 2. The similar correlation between the different measuring instruments was expected to be a result of them using the same hardware counters and MSRs. When choosing the best measuring instrument, SCAP and SCAPI was excluded despite a high correlation given a low sample rate and a tedious setup process. Between IPG and LHM, the performance was equal, where IPG was more correlated on MB and LHM on FR. The choice ended up being on IPG, given a better user experience. 


% For the remaining experiments, we chose the software-based instrument based on considerations of accuracy, ease of use, and availability as expressed in \cref{RQ:RQ2}. While SCAPI had the highest correlation on both MB and FR, it and SCAP had a low sample rate and was tedious to set up on Windows, therefore it is not picked. LHM and IPG were close as IPG was slightly more correlated with the Clamp (W) on MB, but slightly less on FR. However, LHM had more problems in the setup phase than IPG and also required calculations for getting the measurements in joules, therefore, we chose IPG. %One thing to note is that our determination of accuracy is based of the accuracy of the Clamp, which means that if the Clamp is not accurate, then we do not know if the other measuring instruments are.
