\subsection{Experiment Two}\label{subsec:exp_two}

In this second experiment, the best measuring instrument on Windows will be found between those introduced in \cref{subsec:measuring_instruments}. In terms of what is found to be best, it will be a combination of which measuring instrument will be most correlated with the ground truth, but aspects like ease of use will also be considered. Due to some issues with the measuring instrument Scaphandre, the process priority class of the test case was in this experiment set to \texttt{Normal}. Due to an execution of less than a second for \texttt{Mandelbrot} when compiled on Intel's OneApi, \texttt{Mandelbrot}'s parameter will be changed from $16.000$ to $64.000$ which takes the duration of the test case to $\sim 14$ seconds. This is to avoid a case where the Plug only has a single data point when measuring.
