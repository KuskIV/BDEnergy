\subsection{Deviating Results}

In this work Cochran's formula was used to determine how many measurements were required in order to gain confidence in the results. When calculating how many measurements were required using Cochran's formula, the amount deviated between benchmarks, measuring instrument, DUTs and even cores on the same CPU.

Performance deviate from between cores on the same CPU as a result of the variability in the fabrication process, where the exact characteristics of each core can change, despite being assembled in the same way.\cite{Mauzy2020} When comparing cores of the same type, it was found that the DEC could have a standard deviation of up to $5.67$ j among cores of the same type.

% deviated between $1.17\%$ and $11.61\%$ among cores with the same specs. %% find source to compare $1.17\%$ and $11.61\%$ to

When comparing the required amount of measurements between DUTs, DUT 2 required less measurements than DUT 1. The cause of this could be either software or hardware based. When setting up both DUTs, effort was put into ensuring the DUTs had software with the same versions. Both DUTs executed on a fresh install of Windows, had the same software downloaded and the same background processes were disabled, so it seemed unlikely this was the cause. When comparing hardware, the two DUTs were from different generations of intel CPUs, released five years apart. DUT 1 was the older of the two, but no evidence of newer CPUs deviating more was found by \cite{Ournani2020}. \cite{Ournani2020} however found that a lower TDB could result in a lower energy variation, and DUT 2 had a lower TDP of $65$ W opposed to the TDP of $95W$ found on DUT 1, which could explain the difference\cite{IntelComparison}.

% When comparing hardware, the two DUTs are from different generations of intel CPUs, released five years apart. DUT 1 is the older of the two, and has been used for multiple years, while DUT 2 is brand new. The different components of the two DUTs are also from different brands. Given DUT 1 is older and has been used more could mean it also deviates more, but this is something to explore in a future work. % find source that old hardware use more power
