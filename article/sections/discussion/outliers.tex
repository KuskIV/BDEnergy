\subsection{Outliers}

In this work Cochran's formula was used to determine how many measurements were required in order to gain confidence in our results. When analyzing the results from Cochran's formula, it was found that the amount of measurements could deviate a lot between benchmarks, measuring instrument, DUTs and even cores on the same DUT.

Results can deviate from core to core as a result of the variability in the fabrication process, where the exact characteristics of each core can change, despite being assembled in the same way.\cite{Mauzy2020}
