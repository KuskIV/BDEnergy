\subsection{Time syncronisation}
When creating analyses in the timeseries data it becomes important to make sure that all measurements are recording the expected time slices. This can quickly become a problem if one computer used for measuremnets are out of sync with the rest of the measurements, this could result in wierd looking data, and a hard to identify problem.
