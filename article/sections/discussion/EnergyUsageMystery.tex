\subsection{Energy usage mystery}
One trend discussed in \cref{subsec:exp_two} is the evolution of the average energy consumption over 3000 measurements.  


%The investigation in the energy consumption of the  usage in DUTs has resultet in interesting observations that have yet to be explained. The results indicates that the energy consumtion falling until after around 1000 measurements, the energy consumption of the DUTs seems to level off, although the underlying reason for this remains a mystery.

This trend could be seen on both the Clamp and Plug, which indicates that it is not caused by faulty measurements. However, the same trend could not be observed on the software-based measuring instruments. Therefore we hypothesized that the observed reduction in energy consumption may be caused by changes in the reactive energy consumption occurring between the power outlet and the power supply of the DUTs.

In a circuit, two types of energy can be identified: active energy, which performs useful work, and reactive energy, which does not. The combination of these two energies is called apparent energy, which is what is measured by our hardware-based measuring instruments. Reactive energy occurs because of inductive or capacitive loads in a circuit, resulting in an energy loss that is not utilized by the circuit\cite{ReactP}. The ratio between active and reactive energy is known as the power factor\cite{ReactP}.

Based on this, two hypotheses have been constructed to explain why the energy consumption of the DUTs are changing over measurements. Firstly, noise on the electrical network could interfere with the phase synchronization. This may be due to many machines being connected to the same electrical network, and disrupting the harmonics of the network\cite*{kullarkar2017power}. However, if the power supply generates reactive energy because it is out of phase with the electrical network, a reduction in noise could help synchronize them again. Therefore, the observed changes in energy consumption may be related to the time of the day and week where the measurements are taken, with consumption decreasing when there is less devices connected to the electrical network, during the night and weekends.

Alternatively, the DUTs' power supply unit (PSU) may be correcting the phase over time. PSU's can contain a power factor correction (PFC) circuit that attempts to reduce the amount of reactive power by correcting the phase. There are two main types of PFCs, passive power factor correction (PPFC) and active power factor correction (APFC)\cite{mcdonald2020power}. The behavior seen in the results may be the result of an APFC, but we could not determine whether such a circuit is present in our DUTs. %some psu seems to have them\cite{TomPsuPFC}.

We are unable to determine the exact cause of the changes in energy consumption. The hypotheses presented are both plausible and as computer scientists, this lies outside of our area of expertise. This requires future work to determine, one possible method to confirm or reject these hypotheses could be to measure the power factor with another measuring instrument or incorporate an uninterruptible power supply between the power outlet and the DUT.

%While it is challenging to ascertain the precise causes of the observed changes in energy consumption, both hypotheses are plausible and it might even be a combination of them both. As computer scientists, we acknowledge that this investigation falls outside our area of expertise. Nonetheless, we believe that these hypotheses provide a reasonable basis for further investigation into this intriguing energy usage mystery. A possible ways to confirm or reject this could be to also measure the power factor, with another measuring instrument, or install a uninterruptable power supply (UPS) between the power out let and the DUT, since a common feature of UPS are power filtering.
