\subsection{Background Processes}

To limit background processes on Windows, a few measures were taken.  Firstly when the DUTs were set up, all startup processes in the Task Manager on Windows were also disabled, in addition to non-Microsoft background services found in System Configuration. Exceptions were however made to processes related to Intel.

Secondly, during runtime, different background processes were also stopped. These processes were found by looking at the running processes using command \texttt{Get-Process}. The process of finding processes that were not necessary included finding processes that based on their description did not seem essential, killing them, and observing the result. Based on this, a list of processes was found which are killed using the \texttt{Stop-Process} command before running the experiments. The list can be found in \cref{tab:background_processes}.
