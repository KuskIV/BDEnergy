\paragraph{Scaphandre}
One measuring instrument not used in our previous work is Scaphandre\cite{scaphandre}. Scaphandre is described as a monitoring agent which can measure energy consumption and is made for Linux where it can use Powercap RAPL which is a Linux kernel subsystem where data can be read from RAPL. It also has the functionality of measuring the energy consumption of some virtual machines, specifically Qemu and KVM hypervisors. A driver also exists which allows for installing RAPL on Windows.\cite{RAPL_Windows} Doing so allows using Scaphandre on a Windows computer where the sensor is RAPL which is utilizing the MSRs to update its counters. The Windows version of Scaphandre has some limitations but is able to report the energy consumption of the power domain PKG, using the MSR \textit{MSR\_PKG\_ENERGY\_STATUS}. Furthermore, it can also give an estimation of the energy consumption for individual processes. It does so by storing CPU usage statistics alongside the values of the energy counters. Then it is able to calculate the ratio of the CPU time for each Process ID (PID). With the calculated ratio a new calculation is made to get the subset of the energy consumption which is estimated to belong to a specific PID. A Linux exclusive feature is that the monitoring system Prometheus can be used with Scaphandre to get the energy consumption of an application which consist of several PIDs.
