\noindent\textbf{Scaphandre (SCAP):} is described as a monitoring agent that can measure energy consumption.\cite{scaphandre} It is designed for Linux where it can use Powercap RAPL, a Linux kernel subsystem that reads data from RAPL. Additionally, SCAP can measure the energy consumption of some virtual machines, specifically Qemu and KVM hypervisors. A kernel driver also exists that allows getting RAPL measurements and using SCAP on Windows\cite{RAPL_Windows}. %This enables SCAP to be used on a Windows computer, where the sensor is RAPL, which utilizes the MSRs to update its counters.
The Windows version of SCAP can report the energy consumption of the power domain PKG using the MSR \textit{MSR\_PKG\_ENERGY\_STATUS}. It can also estimate the energy consumption for individual processes by storing CPU usage statistics alongside the energy counter values and then calculating the ratio of CPU time for each Process ID (PID). Using the calculated ratio it estimates the subset of energy consumption that belong to a specific PID.

%A Linux exclusive feature is that the monitoring system Prometheus can be used with Scaphandre to get the energy consumption of an application which consist of several PIDs.
