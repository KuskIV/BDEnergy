\noindent\textbf{Scaphandre (SCAP):} is a monitoring agent able to measure energy consumption.\cite{scaphandre} SCAP is designed for Linux and uses RAPL and can in addition to this measure the energy consumption of some virtual machines. SCAP can also be used on Windows, as a kernel driver exists which allows SCAP to read RAPL measurements from Windows.\cite{RAPL_Windows}. %This enables SCAP to be used on a Windows computer, where the sensor is RAPL, which utilizes the MSRs to update its counters.
The Windows version of SCAP can report the energy consumption of the power domain PKG using the MSR. SCAP can also estimate the energy consumption for individual processes by storing CPU usage statistics alongside the energy counter values and then calculating the ratio of CPU time for each Process ID (PID). Using the calculated ratio, SCAP estimates the subset of energy consumption belonging to a specific PID. In this work, both the performance of SCAP and SCAPs ability to isolate the energy of a process will be used, where the latter will be referenced as SCAPI.

%A Linux exclusive feature is that the monitoring system Prometheus can be used with Scaphandre to get the energy consumption of an application which consist of several PIDs.
