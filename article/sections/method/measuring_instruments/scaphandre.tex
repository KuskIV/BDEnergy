\paragraph{Scaphandre (SCAP):} is described as a monitoring agent that can measure energy consumption.\cite{scaphandre} It is designed for Linux where it can use Powercap RAPL, a Linux kernel subsystem that reads data from RAPL. Additionally, SCAP can measure the energy consumption of some virtual machines, specifically Qemu and KVM hypervisors. A driver also exists for installing RAPL on Windows\cite{RAPL_Windows}. This enables SCAP to be used on a Windows computer, where the sensor is RAPL, which utilizes the MSRs to update its counters.

The Windows version of SCAP has some limitations but can report the energy consumption of the power domain PKG using the MSR \textit{MSR\_PKG\_ENERGY\_STATUS}. Moreover, it can estimate the energy consumption for individual processes. SCAP accomplishes this by storing CPU usage statistics alongside the energy counter values. It then calculates the ratio of CPU time for each Process ID (PID). Using the calculated ratio, SCAP determines the subset of energy consumption estimated to belong to a specific PID.

%A Linux exclusive feature is that the monitoring system Prometheus can be used with Scaphandre to get the energy consumption of an application which consist of several PIDs.
