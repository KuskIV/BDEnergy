\subsection{Compilers}

In this section the different C++ compilers used will be introduced. Some of the compilers are based on \cite{hassan2017}, where it was found that applications compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ and MinGW had the lowest energy consumption. In addition to this Intel OneApi C++ compiler and Clang was also included as both can be found on lists of the most popular C++ compilers\cite{mycplus, educba, softwaretestinghelp}.

\paragraph{Clang:} The Clang compiler is open source and builds on the LLVM optimizer and code generator. The compiler was released in 2007, and is available on both Linux and Windows.\cite{clang}

\paragraph*{MinGW:} The MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is an open source compiler based on the GNU GCC project, which compiles code to be run on Windows. MinGW can can also be cross-hosted on Linux.\cite{mingw}

\paragraph*{Intel OneApi C++:} The Intel OneApi is a set of libraries and other tools aiming to simplify development across different hardware. One of these tools is the C++ compiler, which implements SYCL, this being an evolution of C++ for heterogeneous computing. The compiler is available for both Windows and Linux.\cite{oneapi}

\paragraph*{MSVC:} Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) is a set of libraries and tools aiming to help developers build high performance code. One of the tools included is a C++ compiler. This compiler is only available on Windows.\cite{msvc}
