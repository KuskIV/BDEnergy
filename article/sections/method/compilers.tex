\subsection{Compilers}

This section introduces the various C++ compilers used in this study. Some of the compilers are based on \cite{hassan2017}, which found that applications compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ and MinGW exhibited the lowest energy consumption. Additionally, the Intel OneApi C++ compiler and Clang were included as both can be found on lists of the most popular C++ compilers\cite{mycplus, educba, softwaretestinghelp}.

\paragraph{Clang:} The Clang compiler is open source and builds on the LLVM optimizer and code generator. The compiler was released in 2007 and is available on both Windows and Linux.\cite{clang}

\paragraph*{MinGW:} MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is an open-source compiler based on the GNU GCC project, designed to compile code for execution on Windows. Additionally, MinGW can be cross-hosted on Linux.\cite{mingw}

\paragraph*{Intel OneApi C++:} Intel OneApi is a suite of libraries and tools aimed at simplifying development across different hardware. One of these tools is the C++ compiler, which implements SYCL, this being an evolution of C++ for heterogeneous computing. The compiler is available for both Windows and Linux.\cite{oneapi}

\paragraph*{MSVC:} Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) comprises a set of libraries and tools designed to assist developers in building high-performance code. One of the included tools is a C++ compiler, which is only available for Windows\cite{msvc}.
