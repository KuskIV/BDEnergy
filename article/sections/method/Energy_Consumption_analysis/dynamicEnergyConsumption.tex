\paragraph{Dynamic Energy Consumption}
In \cite{fahad2019comparative,biksbois} dynamic energy consumption (DEC) was utilized to enable comparison between the software-based measuring instruments and the hardware-based measuring instruments. DEC is also used in our work. A brief explanation of DEC based on \cite{fahad2019comparative} is given:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamicEnergy}
    E_D = E_T - (P_S * T_E)
\end{equation}
In \cref{eq:dynamicEnergy} $E_D$ is the dynamic energy consumption, $E_T$ is the total energy consumption of the system, $P_S$ is the energy consumption when the system is idle and $T_E$ is the duration of the program execution. With this equation the energy consumption of the test case is isolated. Using DEC requires also measuring the energy consumption on an idle case. \cite{fahad2019comparative}
