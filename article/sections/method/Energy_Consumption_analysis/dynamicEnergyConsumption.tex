\paragraph{Dynamic Energy Consumption}
In \cite{biksbois} dynamic energy consumption (dec) was utilized to enable comparison between the software-based measuring instruments and the hardware-based measuring instruments. dec is also used in this work. A brief explanation of dec based on \cite{biksbois} is given:
The equation for dec is shown in \cref{eq:dynamicEnergy}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamicEnergy}
    E_D = E_T - (P_S * T_E)
\end{equation}

Where $E_D$ is the dynamic energy consumption, $E_T$ is the total energy consumption of the system, $P_S$ is the energy consumption when the system is idle and $T_E$ is the duration of the program execution.\cite{biksbois} With this equation the energy consumption of the test case is isolated. Using dec requires also measuring the energy consumption on an idle case.
