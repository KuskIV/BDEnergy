\subsection{Dynamic Energy Consumption}\label[subsec]{subsec:DEC}
Dynamic Energy Consumption (DEC) was utilized in \cite{fahad2019comparative,biksbois} to enable comparison between the software-based measuring instruments and the hardware-based measuring instruments, where the former measures energy consumption of the CPU only and the latter the entire DUT. DEC was also used in our work. A brief explanation of DEC based on \cite{fahad2019comparative} is given:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamicEnergy}
    E_D = E_T - (P_S * T_E)
\end{equation}
In \cref{eq:dynamicEnergy} $E_D$ is the DEC, $E_T$ is the total energy consumption of the system, $P_S$ is the energy consumption when the system is idle and $T_E$ is the duration of the program execution. With this equation the energy consumption of the benchmark is isolated. Using DEC requires also measuring the energy consumption on an idle case. \cite{fahad2019comparative}
