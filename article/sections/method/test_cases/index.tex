\subsection{Benchmarks}\label[subsec]{subsec:test_cases}

This work employed microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks to asses the measuring instruments and analyze the energy consumption. The introduction and the rationale behind why the specific benchmarks were selected can be found in this section.

\paragraph{Microbenchmarks:} are small, focused benchmarks testing only a specific operation, algorithm, or piece of code. They are useful for measuring the performance of some particular code precisely while minimizing the impact of other factors, but they may not accurately represent overall performance.\cite{MicroVSMacro}

The microbenchmarks used in this work were from the Computer Language Benchmark Game \footnote{\url{https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html}}. The selected benchmarks included single- and multi-threaded microbenchmarks compatible with the compilers and OSs used in this work. Certain libraries, such as \texttt{<sched.h>}, were unavailable on Windows, limiting the pool of compatible microbenchmarks. The chosen microbenchmark benchmarks and their abbreviation were presented in \cref{tab:microbenchmarks}, where the parameters were those specified by the Computer Language Benchmark Game. During compilation, the only parameter given is \texttt{-openmp} for the multi-core benchmarks, ensuring optimization for all cores of the DUT.

\paragraph{Macrobenchmarks:} are large-scale benchmarks testing the performance of an entire application or system. Macrobenchmarks provide a more comprehensive overview of how the system performs in real-world scenarios and are more suitable for understanding the overall performance of an application or system.\cite{MicroVSMacro} Application-level benchmarks are a type of marcobenchmarks testing an application, which provides a more realistic benchmark scenario. 

The two macrobenchmarks used in this work were made by UL Solutions. One was 3DMark (3DM), a set of benchmarks for scoring GPUs and CPUs based on gaming performance. From 3DM, the CPU Profiler benchmark was used, as this work focuses on the energy consumption of the CPU. The CPU Profile benchmarks executes a 3D graphic, but the main component of the workloads is from a boids flocking behavior simulation.\cite{3dmark}. The other macrobenchmarks was PCMark 10 (PCM), a benchmark meant to test various tasks seen at a workplace. PCM has three test groups, including web browsing, video conferencing, working in spreadsheets, and photo editing. The full list can be seen in \cref{tab:PCMark10Dut1,tab:PCMark10Dut2}.\cite{pcmark} The versions of both macrobenchmarks can be seen in \cref{tab:macrobenchmarks}.
