\subsection{Device Under Tests}
Two workstations were used in the experiments conducted. Both DUTs were chosen to enable comparison between CPUs with and without P- and E-cores. When the two DUTs were set up, they were updated to have the same version of Windows and Linux. In \cref {tab:DUT1,tab:DUT2} the specifications of the two workstations can be seen, referred to as DUT 1 and DUT 2.

% When running the experiments, the recommendations presented in \cite{Lindholt2022} were followed. These included that the WiFi, Intel Turbo Boost and hyperthreading was disabled. Lastly, the CPU was set to static, which was achieved by disabling the C-states in the bios.
