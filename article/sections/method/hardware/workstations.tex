\subsection{Device Under Tests}
Two workstations are used as DUTs in the experiments. This was chosen to enable comparison between a CPU with and without P- and E-cores. In \cref {tab:DUT1,tab:DUT2} the specifications for the two workstations can be seen. They will be referred to as DUT 1 and DUT 2.
