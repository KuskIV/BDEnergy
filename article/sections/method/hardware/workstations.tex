\subsection{Device Under Tests}

Two workstations were used in the experiments. The DUTs were chosen to compare CPUs with and without P- and E-cores. Upon setup of the DUTs, they were updated to have the same version of Windows and Linux, and in \cref {tab:DUT1,tab:DUT2}, the specifications of the two workstations, referred to as DUT 1 and DUT 2, can be seen.

% When running the experiments, the recommendations presented in \cite{Lindholt2022} were followed. These included that the WiFi, Intel Turbo Boost and hyperthreading was disabled. Lastly, the CPU was set to static, which was achieved by disabling the C-states in the bios.
