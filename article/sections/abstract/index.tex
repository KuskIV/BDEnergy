\begin{abstract}
    With the evolution of CPUs over the last few years, increasing the number of cores has become the norm. Through four research questions, this research investigates the performance gains obtained from the additional processing power and the impact of the P- and E-cores on parallel software.
    The analysis uses benchmarks, considering energy consumption and execution time on a per-core basis and an increasing number of cores. The experiments are conducted primarily on Windows, where Intel's Running Average Power Limit is unavailable, with Linux as a reference point. To compare the performance of measuring instruments made for Windows when running both micro- and macrobenchmarks, we refer to where the body of knowledge is more extensive in this domain, Linux.

    % In recent years, CPUs have been evolving to have more cores as the standard. This research aims to explore how the added processing power and the P- and E-cores affect parallel software performance through four research questions. The analysis uses benchmarks to measure energy consumption and execution time per core as well as with an increasing number of cores. The experiments are primarily conducted on Windows, where Intel's Running Average Power Limit is not available. To ensure accurate measurement of micro- and macrobenchmarks on Windows, we compare them to the more extensive body of knowledge in this domain on Linux.

    % We compare alternative measurement methods for Windows. The benchmarks in this work include both microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks.
    % With the evolution of CPUs over the last few years, an increase in the number of cores has become the norm. This work investigates the performance gains obtained from the additional processing power and the impact of the P- and E-cores. Performance is analyzed using benchmarks, considering both energy consumption and execution time on a per-core basis and with an increasing number of cores. As this work is based on Windows, where Intel's Running Average Power Limit is unavailable, we compare alternative measurement methods for Windows. The benchmarks in this work include both microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks illustrating a more realistic test case.
