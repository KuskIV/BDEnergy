\section{Related Work}\label[section]{relatedWork}
This section provided an overview of related work in energy consumption, parallel software, compilers, and AMPs. It was built upon our previous work \textit{"A Comparison Study of Measuring Instruments"}\cite{biksbois}, where different measuring instruments were compared to explore whether a viable software-based measuring instrument was available for Windows. It was found that Intel Power Gadget (IPG) and Libre Hardware Monitor (LHM) on Windows and Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) on Linux had a similar correlation to hardware-based measuring instruments.\cite{biksbois}
