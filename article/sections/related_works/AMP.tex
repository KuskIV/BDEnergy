\subsection{Asymmetric Multicore Processors}
AMPs are CPUs where all the cores are not treated equally. One example of this is the combination of performance cores and efficiency cores as seen in Intel's Alder Lake and Raptor Lake. Intel's Thread Director (ITD) was presented with Intel's Alder Lake. The purpose of ITD is to assist the operating system decided on which cores to run a thread.
%% At the time of the paper ITD did not exist on Linux, however, it does now.
In \cite{saez2022evaluation} support for utilizing ITD in Linux is created, however, official support for ITD has since been released. Additionally, some SPEC benchmarks were conducted to analyze the estimated Speedup Factor(SF) from the ITD compared to the observed SF. SF is the relative benefit a thread gets from running on a P-core. It looked at which classes were assigned to different threads in the benchmark, where it found that 99.9\% of class readings were class 0 or 1. Class 0 is for threads that perform similarly on P- and E-cores. Class 1 is for threads where P-cores are preferred.\cite{Intel202?whitepaper} Furthermore class 3 was not used, which is for threads that are preferred to be on an E-core. The experiment indicated that the ITD overestimated the SF of using the P-cores for many threads, but also underestimated it for some threads. Overall it was found that the estimated SF had a low correlation coefficient $(<0.1)$ with the observed values. Furthermore, a performance monitoring counter (PMC) based prediction model was trained. The model outperformed ITD, but it still produced some mistakes, however, the correlation coefficient was higher at $(>0.8)$. Then it implemented support for the IDT in different Linux scheduling algorithms and compared the results from using the IDT and the PMC-based model. It found that the PMC-based model gave superior SF predictions than ITD.\cite{saez2022evaluation}
