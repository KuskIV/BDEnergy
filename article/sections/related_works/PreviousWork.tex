\subsection{Previous Work}
This paper builds upon the knowledge gathered in our previous work \textit{"A Comparison Study of Measuring Instruments"}\cite{biksbois} where different measuring instruments were compared to explore whether a viable software-based measuring instrument was available for Windows. It was found that Intel Power Gadget (IPG) and Libre Hardware Monitor (LHM) on Windows have similar correlation to hardware-based measuring instruments as Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) has on Linux. This chapter builds upon the related work chapter of the previous work and as such will not be repeated, however, it will be expanded upon.
