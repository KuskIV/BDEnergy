\subsection{Previous Work}
This work/paper builds upon the knowledge gathered in our previous work \textit{"A Comparison Study of Measuring Instruments"}\cite{biksbois} which compared several different measuring instruments to explore whether a viable software-based measuring instrument is available on systems running Windows. It was found that Intel Power Gadget (IPG) and Libre Hardware Monitor (LHM) on Windows have a very similar correlation to hardware-based measuring instruments as Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) has on Linux. This chapter builds upon the related work chapter of the previous work and as such will not be repeated, however, it will be expanded upon.
