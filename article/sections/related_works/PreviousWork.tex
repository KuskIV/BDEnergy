\subsection{Previous Work}
%This paper builds upon the knowledge gathered 
In our previous work \textit{"A Comparison Study of Measuring Instruments"}\cite{biksbois} where different measuring instruments were compared to explore whether a viable software-based measuring instrument was available for Windows. It was found that Intel Power Gadget (IPG) and Libre Hardware Monitor (LHM) on Windows have similar correlation to hardware-based measuring instruments as Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) has on Linux. The remainder of this chapter builds upon the related work chapter in \cite{biksbois} and as such will not be repeated, however, it will be expanded upon.
