\subsection{Scheduling Priority}\label[subsec]{subsec:scheduling}

Scheduling threads on Windows, is done based on each thread's scheduling priority level and the priority class of the process. The priority class can be either \texttt{IDLE}, \texttt{BELOW NORMAL} \texttt{NORMAL}, \texttt{ABOVE NORMAL}, \texttt{HIGH} or \texttt{REALTIME}, where the default is \texttt{NORMAL}. It is noted that \texttt{HIGH} priority should be used with care, as other threads in the system will not get any processor time while that process is running. If a process needs \texttt{HIGH} priority, it is recommended to raise the priority class temporarily. The \texttt{REALTIME} priority class should only be used for applications that "talk" to hardware directly, as this class will interrupt threads managing mouse input, keyboard inputs, etc.\cite{priority}

The priority level can be either \texttt{IDLE}, \texttt{LOWEST}, \texttt{BELOW NORMAL}, \texttt{NORMAL}, \texttt{ABOVE NORMAL}, \texttt{HIGHEST} and \texttt{TIME CRITICAL}, where the default is \texttt{NORMAL}. A typical strategy is to increase the level of the input threads for applications to ensure they are responsive, and to decrease the level for background processes, meaning they can be interrupted as needed.\cite{priority}

The scheduling priority is assigned to each thread as a value from zero to $31$, where this value is called the base priority. The base priority is decided using both the thread priority level and the priority class, where a table showing the scheduling priority given these two parameter can be found in \cite{priority}.

%When assigning a base priority where both the priority class and thread priority are the default values, e.i. \texttt{NORMAL}, the base priority is $8$.\cite{priority} %The idea of having different priorities is to treat threads with the same priority equally, by assigning time slices to each thread in a round-robin fashion, starting with the highest priority. In the case of none of the highest priority threads being ready to run, the lower priority threads will be assigned time slices. The lower-priority threads will then execute until a higher-priority thread is available, in which case the system will assign a full time slice to the thread, and stop executing the lower-priority threads, without time to finish using its time slice.\cite{priority}

When setting scheduling priority, the priority class is supported for both Windows and Linux, while the priority level is only supported for Windows. An example of how both priorities are set for a process and its threads can be seen in \cref{lst:priority}.
