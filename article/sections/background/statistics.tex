This section presents the statistical method used to analyze the results. It is based on \cite{biksbois}, and further detail can be found there.\newline %A common assumption is that the data follows the normal distribution \cite{fahad2019comparative}


\noindent\textbf{Shapiro-Wilk Test:} was used to examine if the data followed a normal distribution. %, which is an assumption for some statistical methods. 
The data in this study was not expected to follow a normal distribution, which aligns with what was found in \cite{biksbois}. Understanding the distribution of the data was important, as some statistical methods assume the data is normally distributed.\cite{razali2011power}\newline

\noindent\textbf{Mann-Whitney U Test:}
The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to evaluate if there was a statistically significant difference between samples. It is a non-parametric test that does not assume normality in the data.\cite{mann1947test}\newline

%Since our data is not normally distributed, a non-parametric test was used to evaluate whether there were statistically significant differences between various measurements. The Mann-Whitney U test was used due to its capacity to compare two independent samples without assuming normality.

\noindent\textbf{Kendall's Tau Correlation Coefficient:} is a non-parametric measure of association able to evaluate the strength and direction of relationships between ordinal variables when the underlying data is not normally distribution.\cite{han1987non}. Kendall's Tau Correlation Coefficient is evaluated using the Guilford scale in \cref{fig:GuildfordScale}.\cite[219]{guilford1950fundamental}\newline

%Additionally, Kendall's Tau is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data.

\noindent\textbf{Cochran's Formula:}
is used to estimate how many measurements are required to achieve a desired confidence level.\cite{Cochran}\newline


\noindent In summary, the selection of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient, and Cochran's formula made it possible to analyze the non-normal distributed data obtained while determining statistically significant differences, correlations, and appropriate sample size for the measurements.
