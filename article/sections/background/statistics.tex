\paragraph{Statistical Methods}
The objective of this section is to describe the statistical methods employed in this work. These methods will aim to validate our findings.

\paragraph{Shapiro-Wilk Test:} will be used to examine if the data follows a normal distribution, which is an important assumption for some statistical methods. Prior research suggests that our data will most likely not be normally distributed \cite{biksbois}, so this hypothesis will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Understanding the distribution of the data will help choose subsequent statistical tests.

\paragraph{Mann-Whitney U Test:}
Given our data will most likely not be normally distributed, a non-parametric test will be used to evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences between various measurements. For this, Mann-Whitney U test was picked due to its capacity to compare two independent samples without assuming normality, providing a robust evaluation of differences between groups.

\paragraph{Kendall's Tau Correlation Coefficient:}
to assess the correlations between a measurements and the ground truth, Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient will be used. This non-parametric measure of association has been chosen because it can evaluate the strength and direction of relationships between ordinal variables, even when the underlying data does not adhere to a normal distribution. Additionally, Kendall's Tau is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data.

\paragraph{Cochran's Formula:}
To determine an appropriate sample size for our research project, Cochran's formula will be used. This method is advantageous because it allows for the calculation of an optimal sample size to achieve the desired level of statistical power while minimizing the risk of false positives and false negatives.


In summary, the selection of the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient, and Cochran's formula, reflects our commitment to using rigorous and appropriate statistical methods in this paper.
