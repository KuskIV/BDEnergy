\subsection{CPU States}\label[subsec]{subsec:cpustates}

CPU-states (C-state) manage a systems energy consumption during different operational conditions. On a CPU, each core has its own state, which dictates how much the core is shut down in order to conserve power. The \texttt{C0} state represents the normal operation of a core under load where the number of states vary between CPUs and the number of supported states vary between motherboards.\cite{CIntel,CHard} The CPU used in \cite{biksbois} had $10$ states, where states higher than $C0$ represents an increasingly shut down core and the highest states will mean the core is almost inactive.\cite{biksbois}. 

% It is important to note that the number of C-states supported may vary depending on the CPU and motherboard in use, in \cite{biksbois} the DUT supported C0 to C10 states.
% In addition to C-states, there are other states such as CC-states (Core C-states), PC-states (Package C-states), Thread C-states, and Hyper-Thread C-states. However, information on these states is limited. Enhanced C-states (C1E), which can shut down more components of the CPU than C0 but not as much as the next C-state, are also present in some CPUs.

% P-states are used only during C0 state and determine the frequency of the CPU under load, thereby managing its energy consumption. S-states (Sleep State), on the other hand, control how the system uses energy on a larger scale by determining whether the system is sleeping or not. All C-states occur within S0, with deeper states of sleep such as Sleep and Hibernation being defined by increments.

% The G-states (Global-States) define the overall state of the system. G0 represents a working computer where C-states, P-states, and S0 states can occur, while G3 represents a completely shut-down system.
The C-states can have a large impact on the energy consumption of the benchmarks, especially the idle case as was found in \cite{biksbois}.
