\subsection{Processor Affinity}\label[type]{subsec:affinity}

Processor affinity allows applications to bind or unbind a process to a specific set of cores. When a process is pinned to a core, the OS ensures that the process only executes on the assigned core(s) each time it is scheduled.\cite{affinity} When setting the affinity for a process in C\#, it is done through a bitmask, where each bit represents a CPU core. An example was illustrated in \cref{lst:affinity}, where the process was allowed to execute on core $\#0$ and $\#1$.

% % Affinity is a feature enabling processes to be bound to specific cores.
% % Jobs and threads are constantly rescheduled for optimal system performance on an OS, meaning that the same process can be assigned to different cores on the CPU.

% % Processor affinity is useful for scaling performance on multi-core processor architectures sharing the same global memory and have local caches referred to as the Uniform memory access architecture.\cite{affinity}
