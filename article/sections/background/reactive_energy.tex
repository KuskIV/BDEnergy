\subsection{Apparent Energy}

In a circuit, two types of energy can be identified: active energy, which performs useful work, and reactive energy, which does not. The combination of these two energies is called apparent energy, which is what is measured by hardware-based measuring instruments. Reactive energy occurs because of inductive or capacitive loads in a circuit, resulting in an energy loss not utilized by the circuit\cite{ReactP}. The ratio between active and reactive energy is known as the power factor\cite{ReactP}.
