\subsection{Performance and Efficiency cores}
In the past the CPU architecture x86 has had a core layout comprised of identical cores, disregarding the silicon lottery. However, the ARM architecture introduced the big.LITTLE layout in 2011\cite{ARM2011origin}. It is an architecture that utilizes two types of cores, a set for maximum energy efficiency and a set for maximum computer performance.\cite{ARMWhatIsIt}. Intel introduced a hybrid architecture in 2021\cite{Intel2021Alder} codenamed Alder lake, which is similar to ARM's big.LITTLE architecture. Alder lake also has two types of cores: performance cores (P-cores) and efficiency cores (E-cores). These types of cores are optimized for different tasks. P-cores function as standard CPU cores, which focus on maximizing performance. In contrast, the E-cores are designed to maximize performance per watt and are intended to handle smaller non-time critical jobs, such as background services\cite{rotem2022intel}.
