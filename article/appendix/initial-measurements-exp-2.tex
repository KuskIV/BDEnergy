\section{Initial Measurements in Experiment Two}\label{app:exp_two_coch}

This section illustrated the required measurements for the different measuring instruments, which were estimated using Cochran's formula for a desired confidence level of 95\% and a margin of error of 0.03\%. They were used in \cref{subsec:exp_two}.
