\section{Energy Consumption Over Time}\label{app:timeseries}

This section illustrated how the energy consumption of both macrobenchmarks evolved over time for DUT 2. The analysis was used in the third experiment in \cref{subsec:exp_three}, and compares the energy consumption for two and ten cores, to show the difference.

Measurements for 3DM were illustrated in \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_2_3dm_timeseries_all_cores} and \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_3dm_timeseries_two_cores} for both two and ten cores, both have a similar startup period until $~14$ seconds, after which the benchmark started. On ten cores,  the load was on $~25$ watts for $~18$ seconds, while for two cores the energy consumption was on $~12$ watts for $~60$ seconds.

Measurements for PCM were illustrated in \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_all_cores} and \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_2_core}. Compared to 3DM, there were smaller differences between two and ten cores. One cause was that PCM required fewer resources, meaning additional resources had diminishing returns. When looking at \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_2_core}, it was observed that the peak wattage usage of $~12$ for 3DM on two cores was exceeded during runtime. This occurred between $225s-235s$, $370s-380s$, and $570s-620s$, which amounts to $9\%$ of the total runtime. This indicated that the affinity was only set for some processes related to PCM, which meant that too many resources were allocated to some processes. We could not solve this, meaning the performance gained when allocating more cores to PCM represents a lower limit. Because if the affinity were set correctly, the execution time would be higher on a few cores, resulting in more significant decreases in execution time when allocating additional cores.
