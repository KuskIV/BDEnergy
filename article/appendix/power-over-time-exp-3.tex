\section{Energy Consumption Over Time}\label{app:timeseries}

This section shows how both macrobenchmarks energy consumption evolves over time for DUT 2, used in \cref{subsec:exp_three}. In this section 3DM and PCM are plottet with two cores and all cores to illustrate the difference the additional resources make. 

3DM is illustrated in \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_2_3dm_timeseries_all_cores} and \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_3dm_timeseries_two_cores}, where different phases of 3DM can be observed. For both two and ten cores there is a startup period until around $14$ seconds, after which the benchmark starts. On ten cores, load is on $25$ watts for $18$ seconds, while for two cores the energy consumption is on $12$ watts for $60$ seconds.

For PCM, the graphs illustrating the energy consumption over time, can be seen in \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_all_cores} and \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_2_core}, where a smaller difference could be found between two and ten cores compared to 3DM. One reason was the load of PCM, which did not require as many resources, meaning the additional resources gave a diminishing return. When looking at \cref{fig:exp_3_dut_1_pcm_timeseries_2_core} it was observed that the peak wattage usage of $12$ for 3DM on two cores was exceeded during runtime. This happened between $225s-235s$, $370s-380s$ and $570s-620s$, which amounts to $9\%$ of the total runtime. This indicated that the affinity was not set for all processes related to PCM, resulting in too many resources being allocated to some processes. An effort was put into fixing this, but without success. This meant that the table in \cref{tab:app-results} represents lower values for PCM of how much performance was gained when allocating more resources, as for fewer cores the DEC and runtime would be higher, and for more cores it would be lower, if the affinity was set correctly for all processes.
