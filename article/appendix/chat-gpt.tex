\section{ChatGPT}\label{app:chat-gpt}

In this work ChatGPT, the language model made by OpenAI, has been used to a limited extend to replace Google search. This for example included assistance to setup Scaphandre given the limited documentation, and assistance with C++ given our limited experience with this language. ChatGPT also proved useful when searching for keywords for further research using google, when learning about a new domain.ChatGPT has not given us any information we could not have found on Google, and has not been used to analyze any results or write any of this project.
