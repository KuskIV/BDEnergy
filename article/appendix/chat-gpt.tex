\section{ChatGPT}\label{app:chat-gpt}

In this work ChatGPT, the language model made by OpenAI, has been used to a limited extend to replace Google search. This for example included assistance to setup Scaphandre given the limited documentation, and assistance with C++ given our limited experience with this language. Given this, ChatGPT has not given us any information we could not have found on Google, and has not been used to analyze any results or write any of this project.
