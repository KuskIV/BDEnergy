\section{Cochran's Formula Evolution for Experiment Two}\label{app:cockh_exp}

This section illustrated the evolution of how many measurements were required, as estimated using Cochran's formula, for an increasing number of measurements. The graph was used in the second experiment, presented in \cref{subsec:exp_two}.
