\section{PCMark 10}

Given issues with some scenarios on PCM, some scenarios were excluded for the DUTs, where the excluded scenarios were not the same across both DUTs. The different scenarios and whether they are included are shown on \cref{tab:PCMark10Dut1,tab:PCMark10Dut2}. Further detail about the workloads can be found in \cite{pcmark}. PCM was presented in \cref{subsec:test_cases}, while the issues were presented in \cref{subsec:windows_discussion}.
