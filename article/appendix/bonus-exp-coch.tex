\section*{Measurements Requied in Experiment Three P vs. E Cores}\label{app:p-vs-e}

This section illustrated how many measurements were required from IPG when the energy consumption of PCM on four P cores, four E cores, or two of each was measured. These results were referenced in \cref{subsec:exp_three}
