\section*{Measurements Requied in Experiment Three P vs. E Cores}\label{app:p-vs-e}

This section illustrates how many measurements are required from IP when measuring the energy consumption of PCM on four P cores, four E cores, or two of each. These results are referenced in \cref{subsec:exp_three}
