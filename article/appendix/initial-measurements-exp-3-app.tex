\section{Measurements Required in Experiment Three Macrobenchmarks}\label{app:exp_three_coch_app}

This section illustrates how many measurements are required from IPG when measuring the energy consumption of the macrobenchmarks in order to gain confidence in them, and are used in \cref{subsec:exp_three}.
