# Exploring the Energy Consumption of Highly Parallel Software on Windows

This repository is a study of highly parallel software on software, which explores how the dynamic energy consumption and execution time is effect when executing macrobenchmarks on an increasing number of cores.

This work is made as a Masters Project in Computer Science at AAU by Mads Hjuler Kusk, Jamie Baldwin Pedersen and Jeppe Jon Holt, in cooperation with Lone Leth Thomsen and Bent Thomsen, and contains the code, article and documentation. The project was written in the spring of 2023.

### Abstract:

> With the evolution of CPUs over the last few years, increasing the number of cores has become the norm. This research investigates the performance gains obtained from the additional processing power and the impact of the P- and E-cores on parallel software through four research questions. The analysis is conducted using benchmarks, taking into account energy consumption and execution time on a per-core bases and on an increasing number of cores. The experiments conducted in primarily done on Windows, where Intel's Running Average Power Limit is unavailable, with Linux as a reference point. The reference to Linux is made, to compare the performance of measuring instruments made for Windows when running both micro- and macrobenchmarks.
